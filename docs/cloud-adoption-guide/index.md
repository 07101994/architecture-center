# Azure Cloud Adoption Guide

The cloud presents a fundamental shift in the way that enterprises procure and utilize technology resources. In the past, enterprises assumed ownership and responsibility of all levels of technology from infrastructure to software. Now, the cloud offers the potential to transform the way enterprises utilize technology by provisioning and consuming resources as needed.

While the cloud offers nearly unlimited flexibility in terms of design choices, enterprises seek proven and consistent methodology for the adoption of cloud technologies. And, each enterprise has different goals and timelines for cloud adoption, making a a one-size-fits-all approach to adoption nearly impossible.

The Azure cloud adoption guide outlines and enumerates the design decisions necessary to incorporate Azure into an enterprise's existing infrastructure, operations, and governance. The guide then provides implementation guidance and recommendations for each decision.

This guide provides guidance on enterprise adoption of the cloud. It includes sections covering background content about the challenges of adopting the cloud, strategies for planning adoption of the cloud, and enumerates the technology and architecture choices for adopting the cloud.

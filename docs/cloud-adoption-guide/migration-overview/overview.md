# Overview: Cloud Adoption

- this guide covers:
    - cloud adoption background
        - differences between on-prem environment and cloud environment
        - not possible to transition everything at once (i.e. not one big switch gets thrown and suddenly you're in the cloud)
        - people's roles and responsibilities will change at different rates, company culture will have to change
        - the amount of cloud adoption is on a continuum
            - on one side, treating the cloud as just more on-prem capacity, extending security perimeter to contain cloud VMs
            - on the other side, tearing down on-prem (or having never had on-prem) and replacing it completely with cloud
        - depending on where you are on this continuum, there are many things that will be affected
            - governance 
                - on-prem roles to cloud roles
                - on-prem security to cloud security
                - on-prem compliance to cloud compliance
                - on-prem monitoring to cloud monitoring
            - workforce responsibilities
                - Finance migrate from procurement model to provision model
                - IT migrate from managing physical hardware to managing virtual hardware
                - dev and test migrate to DevOps

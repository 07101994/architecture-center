# Architectural discussion framework

The [Azure FastTrack](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/azure) team has developed a series of questions that guide discussions of application architectures for Azure. The FastTrack team uses these questions when they conduct Azure Architectural Guidance sessions for customers in the FastTrack program. You can use these questions within your own organization, to help you plan and validate your architecture on Azure. 

The questions stem from recommended patterns and practices, and contain links to supporting technical documentation. The questions are deliberately open-ended &mdash; they are meant to facilitate discussion among the various stakeholders in your organization. The questions are organized by scenario:

- [Lift and shift](./lift-and-shift.md)
- [Application modernization](./application-modernization.md)
- [Backup, archive and disaster recovery](./backup-archive-disaster-recovery.md)
- [Database](./database.md)
- [Dev/Test](./devtest.md)

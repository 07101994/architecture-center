# Publisher-Subscriber pattern

[!INCLUDE [header](../_includes/header.md)]

Enable a system to send notifications to other interested applications, without the sending system needing to be aware of or directly interface with the receiving systems.

- # Context and problem

Cloud-based applications often need to provide information to other applications as events happen. Asynchronous point-to-point communication via individual messaging channels might be sufficient if there are only a few consumers with limited communication needs. However, this approach cannot scale effectively to a large number of consumers, some of which might be interested only in a subset of the information. Producing applications should not have to keep track of even be aware of consuming applications.

# Solution

Create a **publish-subscribe** message channel, which consists of one input channel for the producing application and one output channel per consuming application. The producing application packages each event into a message using a defined format known to the consumers. The producing application connects to the publish-subscribe channel as the **publisher**, and sends messages via the input channel. Each consuming application subscribes to the publish-subscribe channel, which creates an output channel per **subscriber**. When a message is received via the input channel, the message is copied to each interested subscriber's output channel, typically by intermediary process called a **broker** or a **bus**. The asychronous broadcast approach provides high scalability and resiliency, and allows the producing application to stay responsive while distributing large amounts of information to consumers.

This solution has the following benefits:

    - Benefits (many are asynch brokered messaging in general)
        - *Improves reliability
        - *Improves scalability
        - *Decouples workloads
        - *Temporal decoupling
        - *Cross-platform
        - *Asynchronous workflows
        - Improves testability
    - Broadcast-based (vs. list-based / content-based)

# Issues and considerations

    - Subscriber enrollment / tracking

    - Bi-directional communication (request/reply)

    - Wildcard subscriptions

    - Filter rules

    - Topics -> subscriptions (competing consumer, temporal decoupling, load leveling, and load balancing) 

- {cc, amp} **Message ordering**. The order in which consumer service instances receive messages isn't guaranteed, and doesn't necessarily reflect the order in which the messages were created. Design the system to ensure that message processing is idempotent because this will help to eliminate any dependency on the order in which messages are handled. For more information, see [Idempotency Patterns](http://blog.jonathanoliver.com/idempotency-patterns/) on Jonathon Oliverâ€™s blog.

- {amp} **Message priority**. Some solutions may require that messages are processed in a specific order. The [Priority Queue pattern](priority-queue.md) provides a mechanism for ensuring specific messages are delivered before others.

- {amp, cc} **Poison message detection and handling**. A malformed message, or a task that requires access to resources that aren't available, can cause a service instance to fail. The system should prevent such messages being returned to the queue. Instead, capture and store the details of these messages elsewhere so that they can be analyzed if necessary.

    - *Repeated messages
    - *Message expiration
    - *Message scheduling 
    - *Idempotency for partially completed work? 
    - Transaction handling vs eventual consistency
    - Distinguish between events (action events, data point events) and messages (commands, work jobs, transfers of control)

# When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when:

- An application needs to broadcast information to a significant number of consumers.
- An application needs to communicate with one or more independently-developed consumer applications, which may use different platforms, programming languages, and communication protocols.
- An application can send information to consumers without requiring real-time responses from the consumers.
- The systems being integrated are designed to support an eventual consistency model for their data. 
- An application needs to communicate information to multiple consumers which may have different availability requirements or uptime schedules than the producing application.

This pattern might not be useful when:

- An application has only a few consumers who need significantly different information from the producing application.
- An application requires near real-time replies from consumers.

## Related patterns and guidance

The following patterns and guidance might be relevant when implementing this pattern:

- [Asynchronous Messaging Primer][amp]. Message queues are an asynchronous communications mechanism. If a consumer service needs to send a reply to an application, it might be necessary to implement some form of response messaging. The Asynchronous Messaging Primer provides information on how to implement request/reply messaging using message queues.
